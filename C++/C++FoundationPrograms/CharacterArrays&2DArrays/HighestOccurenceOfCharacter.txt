Highest Occuring Character
For a given a string(str), find and return the highest occurring character.
Example:
Input String: "abcdeapapqarr"
Expected Output: 'a'
Since 'a' has appeared four times in the string which happens to be the highest frequency character, the answer would be 'a'.
If there are two characters in the input string with the same frequency, return the character which comes first.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
abdefgbabfba
Sample Output 1:
b
======================================
char highestOccurringChar(char input[]) {
    // Write your code here
    int freq[256] = { 0 };
    for (int i=0;input[i]!='\0';i++)
    {
        freq[input[i]]++;
    }
    int max =-1;
    char result ;
    for (int i=0;input[i]!='\0';i++)
    {
        if (max < freq[input[i]])
        {
            max = freq[input[i]];
            result = input[i];
        }
    }
    return result;
